Each resistor is paired one at %  a time with the next resistors in the list.  For each combination, a %  record is produced showing the resultant parallel resistance, and the %  values of the two resistors used. This can then be used by a simple bin packing %  program to select and add up the desired resistance from the new resistance%  list.  The bin packing program would then traverse this new list%  accumulating resistance records of value equal or less than the desired %  resistance until the desired resistance is approximated.  The search%  depth determines the sample set size.  %%  The actual resistor list of resistors on hand is also included in the%  new list.%%  The program can search deeper or shallower numbers of%  resistors at a time, however the law of diminishing returs kicks in %  when going very deep, e.g, pairing a 1M resistor with a 1 Ohm resistor is%  of little value.  The search depth limit should be determined by the%  percentage difference between paired resistances.  A depth of six %  seems to accomodate most needs.%%% Usage:% %  The user must input the name of the file containing %  the list of resistors on hand, the search depth, the desired resistance %  and the tolerance.%  The resistor values are then read into to the 'r' array.%  Upon completion, the new expanded resistance list resides in the %  'nc' array.  Each row of the 'nc' array%  contains: New resistance value; Resistor 1; Resistor2%  where Resistor 1 and Resistor 2 are selected from the list of %  owned resistors.  The nc array is then sorted, producing the%  ncsorted array.  Next the desired resitance is computed by selecting %  resistances from the new list to be placed in series.  The computation%  ends when no smaller resistance can be used in series, or when the%  desired tolerance has been met. %%  %%%  %%%  %%  %% run MakeResistorsclear                                                 % Clear the workspaceinstring = input('Resistor list file name ?
